    <h2>
        EXERCISE, STRESS AND SLEEP.
    </h2>
    <p>
    Exercise! Exercise!! Exercise!!!
    I can’t exclaim more.
    Gradually, this generation is becoming a technology-driven one and physical activity
    keeps fading away. I mean we have machines doing most of the jobs, the chores, working 
    from home, you can place an order for food without moving from where you are, it’s all 
    becoming a sedentary lifestyle. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not against technology advancement, 
    all I’m saying is that humans now depend on tech to help do things that they’d normally do 
     to keep the body in an active state. Of course, this is good and beneficial for human race but
    one who seeks to live healthy must make conscious and intentional decisions, exercising the body
    is one of it. Exercise involves any bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness 
    and overall health and wellness. It could be aquarunning, weight training, jogging, yoga, running 
    all these to improve strength, build muscles, lose or maintain weight, improve health or maybe
    just for enjoyment. It doesn’t have to be the gym as I know that that’d be the excuse, a few jumps, 
    squats and stretches in your home could do. Maybe I should show you the types of exercise and why 
    you need to engage in at least a kind of it. Exercise is generally grouped into 3 various groups:
    • Aerobic Exercise • Anaerobic Exercise • Flexibility Exercise
